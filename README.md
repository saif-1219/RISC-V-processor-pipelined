# RISC-V-processor-pipelined
We made this RISC-V pipelined processor for our Computer Architecture project. The processor runs bubble sort algorithm and sorts the array.

The project was divided into 3 tasks:
  First task was to run the bubble sort algorithm on single cycled risc-v provessor.
  Second task was to implement pipelining and forwarding unit.
  The final task was to implement Hazard detection and test the processor.

To run the processor, import the files into a new vivado project and run simulation.
